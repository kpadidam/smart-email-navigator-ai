**Smart Email Categorizer** - Transform your inbox from chaos to clarity with AI# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an experimental project demonstrating the SSA-LAB (Single Sentence Analysis - Laboratory) pattern using Claude Code's custom slash commands. The project orchestrates multiple AI agents in parallel to generate, test, and fix evolving iterations of creative implementations based on specifications or simple ideas.

## Key Commands

### Running the SSA-LAB Creative Laboratory

```bash
claude
```

Then use the `/project:ssa-lab` slash command with these variants:

```bash
# Basic usage (always generates 25 tested iterations in LABS directory)
/project:ssa-lab .claude/example_specs/specs_html_javascript_ui/invent_new_ui_v3.md

# Short idea usage
/project:ssa-lab "Create innovative React component patterns"

# Different spec file
/project:ssa-lab .claude/example_specs/specs_python_pyqt6_ui/create_pyqt6_app_v1.md

# Note: Always generates 25 iterations with testing in the LABS directory
```

## Architecture & Structure

### Command System
The project uses Claude Code's custom commands feature:
- `.claude/commands/ssa-lab.md` - SSA-LAB creative laboratory command with testing
- `.claude/commands/prime.md` - Additional command (if present)
- `.claude/settings.json` - Permissions configuration allowing Write, MultiEdit, Edit, and Bash

### Additional Resources
- `.claude/ai_docs/claude_code_fresh_tutorials.md` - Comprehensive Claude Code tutorials and documentation

### Specification-Driven Generation
- Specifications in `.claude/example_specs/specs_html_javascript_ui/` directory define what type of content to generate
- Available specs: `invent_new_ui_v2.md`, `invent_new_ui_v3.md`, `invent_new_ui_v4.md` - UI Component Specifications
- Specs define naming patterns, content structure, design dimensions, and quality standards

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern
The ssa-lab command implements sophisticated parallel agent coordination with testing:
1. **Specification Analysis** - Deeply understands the spec requirements
2. **Directory Reconnaissance** - Analyzes existing iterations to maintain uniqueness
3. **Parallel Sub-Agent Deployment** - Launches multiple agents with distinct creative directions
4. **Testing & Fixing Protocol** - Each iteration tested and fixed up to 6 times
5. **Wave-Based Generation** - Manages 5 waves of 5 agents for 25 total iterations
6. **Context Management** - Optimizes context usage across all agents

### Generated Content Organization
- `LABS/` - Primary output directory for all tested iterations
- Each iteration includes main file, tests, test logs, and results documentation
- Failed iterations moved to `LABS/experimental/` with documentation

### Key Implementation Details
- Sub-agents receive complete context including spec, existing iterations, and unique creative assignments
- Parallel execution managed through Task tool with waves of 5 agents
- Progressive sophistication strategy across 5 waves
- Each iteration must be genuinely unique, tested, and working
- Testing includes compilation, unit tests, and iterative fixes# Google OAuth Setup Guide

## The Issue
The error you're seeing indicates that your Google OAuth app isn't properly configured. Here's how to fix it:

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
- Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- Make sure you're logged in with the correct Google account

### 2. **Select or Create a Project**
- Click on the project dropdown at the top
- Select your existing project or create a new one

### 3. **Enable Required APIs**
- Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Library**
- Search and enable these APIs:
  - **Google+ API** (or Google Identity)
  - **Gmail API** (for email access)
  - Click "Enable" for each

### 4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**
- Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **OAuth consent screen**
- Select **External** user type
- Fill in the required fields:
  - App name: "Smart Email Navigator"
  - User support email: Your email
  - Developer contact: Your email
  - Authorized domains: Leave empty for local testing
- Click **Save and Continue**

### 5. **Add Scopes**
- Click **Add or Remove Scopes**
- Add these scopes:
  - `openid`
  - `email`
  - `profile`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
- Click **Update** and then **Save and Continue**

### 6. **Add Test Users** (if in testing mode)
- Add your email address as a test user
- Click **Save and Continue**

### 7. **Update OAuth 2.0 Credentials**
- Go to **APIs & Services** ‚Üí **Credentials**
- Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (or create new one)
- Set Application type: **Web application**
- Add Authorized JavaScript origins:
  ```
  http://localhost:5001
  http://localhost
  ```
- Add Authorized redirect URIs:
  ```
  http://localhost:5001/api/auth/google/callback
  ```
- Click **Save**

### 8. **Get New Credentials**
If you created a new OAuth client:
1. Download the credentials JSON
2. Update your `.env` file with:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-new-client-id`
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-new-client-secret`

### 9. **Restart the App**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
python main.py
```

## Alternative: Use Demo Account

While you're setting up Google OAuth, you can use the **Demo Account** to test the app:
1. Go to http://localhost:5001
2. Click **"üöÄ Try Demo Account"**
3. You'll be logged in instantly with sample data

## Common Issues

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"
- Make sure redirect URI matches EXACTLY (including trailing slashes)
- Check that you've enabled all required APIs

### "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"
- The redirect URI in your code must match exactly what's in Google Console
- Check for `http` vs `https` and port numbers

### "This app hasn't been verified"
- This is normal for development
- Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to [App Name] (unsafe)" to proceed

## Still Having Issues?

If Google OAuth is still not working:
1. **Use the Demo Account** - It works immediately without any setup
2. **Deploy to Railway** - Sometimes OAuth works better with a public URL
3. **Create a new OAuth app** - Sometimes starting fresh helps

## For Production (Railway)

When deploying to Railway, add these redirect URIs:
```
https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/google/callback
```

And update your Railway environment variables:
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.railway.app/api/auth/google/callback`# Enhanced Email Navigator Implementation Summary

## Vision
The Smart Email Categorizer transforms email management from a time-consuming chore into an effortless, intelligent experience. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms through FastAPI, the system automatically reads, understands, and categorizes incoming emails into meaningful groups - work, personal, promotional, and spam - with high accuracy. 

Users no longer waste time manually sorting through cluttered inboxes. The AI engine analyzes email content, sender patterns, and contextual clues to instantly organize messages, allowing users to focus on what matters most. The system learns from user corrections, continuously improving its categorization accuracy over time.

Built on FastAPI's high-performance framework, the categorizer processes emails in real-time, ensuring users always have an up-to-date, organized inbox. Integration with Gmail API provides seamless email synchronization, while the intelligent categorization engine works silently in the background, turning chaos into clarity.
