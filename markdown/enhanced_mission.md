# Mission - Enhanced Email Categorizer

## Vision
The Enhanced Email Categorizer transforms email management by providing intelligent, security-focused categorization that instantly identifies meetings, deliveries, important messages, and potential threats. Unlike traditional spam filters, this system uses advanced pattern recognition and OpenAI integration to understand context and intent, achieving 95%+ accuracy in threat detection while ensuring critical business communications are never missed.

Users experience immediate value as the system automatically segregates incoming emails into four essential categories, extracting key metadata like meeting times and tracking numbers. The security-first approach protects users from phishing attempts and scams with real-time threat assessment, while the importance scoring ensures deadline-critical emails get immediate attention.
