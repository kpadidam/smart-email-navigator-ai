# BDD Project Initialized - Enhanced Email Categorizer

## Generated Structure
- ✅ BDD framework configured (behave - already installed)
- ✅ Domain model defined (docs/enhanced_ddd.md)
- ✅ State flow mapped (docs/enhanced_state_diagram.md)
- ✅ Mission clarified (docs/enhanced_mission.md)
- ✅ Features created (features/enhanced_simple.feature)
- ✅ Architecture planned (3 pseudocode files)

## Quick Start
1. Review the generated documents in `docs/`
2. Examine the `features/enhanced_simple.feature` file
3. Check `pseudocode/` for the planned architecture

## Feature File Created
The minimal feature file (`enhanced_simple.feature`) contains 3 critical scenarios:
- **Categorize a meeting invitation** - Tests meeting detection and time extraction
- **Identify a delivery notification** - Tests package tracking recognition
- **Detect a phishing attempt** - Tests security threat detection

## Architecture Overview
The pseudocode defines a simple 3-component system:
1. **enhanced_categorizer.pseudo** - Core categorization logic with security checks
2. **enhanced_data_store.pseudo** - Database operations and threat logging
3. **enhanced_main.pseudo** - Main controller coordinating the system

## Next Steps
Run the bddloop command to:
1. Generate step definitions for the feature file
2. Implement the pseudocode as real Python code
3. Make all BDD tests pass

## Configuration
- **Tech Stack**: Python with FastAPI
- **BDD Framework**: behave
- **App Goal**: Enhanced email categorization with security focus
- **Categories**: Meetings, Deliveries, Important, Phishing/Spam/Scam

## Key Simplifications
- Only 3 scenarios (happy path for each main category)
- Simple pattern matching for initial implementation
- Clear procedural flow without complex abstractions
- Direct security check before categorization
- Minimal metadata extraction (times, tracking numbers)

## To Run Tests
```bash
behave features/enhanced_simple.feature
```

This will show undefined steps that need implementation in the next phase.
